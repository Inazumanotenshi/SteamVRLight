# SteamVR Light

SteamVR Light is a simple Pascal based program that allowes you to change the icon set of your SteamVR window.

Bored of that blue color? Why not try out a new style or build your own one?
SteamVR Light allowes you to easely replace all the pngs that SteamVR access to load the icons of your application.

Because its only pngs there can not happen so much that destroys it.


## Issues

- SteamVR icons will be replaced when you need to fix your SteamVR application over the client
- if there are multiple installations of SteamVR you need to select that one, that you want to change, else it will only replace the iconset of the default SteamVR paths
