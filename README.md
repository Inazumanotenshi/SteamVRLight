# SteamVR Light

SteamVR Light is a simple Pascal based program that allowes you to change the icon set of your SteamVR window.

Bored of that blue color? Why not try out a new style or build your own one?
SteamVR Light allowes you to easely replace all the pngs that SteamVR access to load the icons of your application.

Because its only pngs there can not happen so much that destroys it.

(Example: SteamVR Light Sunrise)

## Issues

- SteamVR icons will be replaced when you need to fix your SteamVR application over the client
- if there are multiple installations of SteamVR you need to select that one, that you want to change, else it will only replace the iconset of the default SteamVR paths

## How to use?

- download the installer from here if it is not included in the pack (https://github.com/Inazumanotenshi/SteamVRLight/releases)
  - copy your image-only pack in the default installer
- select your SteamVR path and let it confirm
- select autostart if you want to instant join SteamVR
- press install
- enjoy!
